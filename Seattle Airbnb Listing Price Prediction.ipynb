    "The motivation of this project is to examine Seattle Airbnb data and answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does location e.g. neighbourhood affect listing price?\n",
    "2. Does the type of property and room affect listing price?\n",
    "3. What are the top 5 factors influencing the listing price? To be answered using Random Forests model. \n",
    "4. Does season affect listing price? We shall see if there is a seasonal trend. (For future work)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will attempt to train a model to predict listing price based on unseen features. "
