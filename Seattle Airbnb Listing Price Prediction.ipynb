    "Airbnb has revolutionised the way travelers and hosts connect with each other. Hosts who have an extra room or house can easily list it on Airbnb to earn extra cash. The hosts can set any price they want. However, there should be a few factors that play a role in deciding the most suitable listing price.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation of this project is to examine Seattle Airbnb data and answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does location e.g. neighbourhood affect listing price?\n",
    "2. Does the type of property and room affect listing price?\n",
    "3. What are the top 5 factors influencing the listing price? To be answered using Random Forests model. \n",
    "4. Does season affect listing price? We shall see if there is a seasonal trend. (For future work)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will attempt to train a model to predict listing price based on unseen features. "
